# Loan-Solvability-Prediction
## 1. Introduction
Loan solvability prediction is crucial for financial institutions to manage risk and make informed lending decisions. Accurate prediction models help in identifying potential defaulters and ensuring a healthy loan portfolio.

## 2. Problem Statement
The goal is to develop a model that predicts the likelihood of a loan applicant repaying the loan based on their profile and historical data.

## 3. Data Description
We will use a dataset containing information about loan applicants, including demographic details, credit history, employment status, loan amount, and loan status (approved or rejected).

## 4. Data Preprocessing
This step includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize the data to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns.

## 6. Model Selection and Training
Choose and train different models, including baseline models and more advanced ones.

## 7. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.
